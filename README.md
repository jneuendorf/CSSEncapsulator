# CSSEncapsulator

A JavaScript tool that breaks CSS inheritance for a specific area.

## Usage

Include the development or production version of the script in your browser:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src="CSSEncapsulator.min.js"></script>
```

## Build

For now, it only works on Unix systems.

Use `make` to create development version.

Use `make production` to create development and production version.

Use `make test` to create test version (development code + jasmine tests). The test file is also called `JQL.js` so you just need to refresh your browser.
